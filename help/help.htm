<h1>Realblog_XH â€“ a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../realblog.png" style="float:left; margin-right:16px" alt="Ring file
with pencil">
<p>Realblog_XH facilitates presenting a blog on your CMSimple_XH website. It
offers the basic blogging features, such as an displaying a chronological
overview of the posts, an optional yearly archive, automatic scheduled
publishing and archiving of posts, searching contents, an RSS feed and very
simplistic categorization. Separately written teasers are supported. Teasers and
articles may contain arbitrary CMSimple_XH scripting. Each blog post can be made
commentable individually, what requires a compatible comments plugin.</p>
<p>For multilingual websites, each language will have its own blog; besides
that, Realblog_XH doesn't have any multilingual capabilities.</p>

<div id="body">

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation <em>before</em> you encounter any
problems!</strong></p>

<h2 id="notice">Important Notice</h2>
<p><strong>Realblog_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments. It is
a so called beta version. Use with caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Realblog_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.6 and
PHP &ge; 5.3.0 with the sqlite3 extension.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory realblog/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
plugins/ directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories css/, config/ and
languages/.</li>
<!--<li>Browse to Realblog's administration (Plugins &rarr; Realblog),
and check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>-->
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select "Realblog" from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Realblog_XH under "Config". Hints for
the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file
available), or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Realblog_XH can be customized under "Stylesheet".
You can also replace the icons used in the plugin administration; there are
alternative icon sets available in the images/ folder.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To display the blog on a CMSimple_XH page, write:</p>
<pre>{{{Realblog_blog();}}}</pre>
<p>To also display the search form, write:</p>
<pre>{{{Realblog_blog(true);}}}</pre>
<p>To display the list of the most recent articles on each page, insert in an
appropritate place in the template:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo Realblog_link('BLOG_URL')?&gt;</pre>
<p>BLOG_URL has to be replaced by the URL of the main blog page. For details
see the description of the <a href="#usage-rss">RSS page setting</a>.</p>
<p>To also display the teasers of these articles, write:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo Realblog_link('BLOG_URL', true)?&gt;</pre>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-administration">Administration</h3>
<p>In the main plugin adminstration you can manage the blog posts. You can
create, edit and delete posts, change their status, etc. The administration is
meant to be pretty much self explaining.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-categories">Categories</h3>
<p>Realblog_XH currently has only very basic support for categories. To define
the categories a post belongs to, enter a <em>comma separated</em> list of
category names in the respective field of the article form:</p>
<pre>Category 1,Category 2</pre>
<p>Note that you can define as many categories as you like.</p>
<p>It is not possible for visitors to filter for categories, but you can prepare
separate CMSimple_XH pages for each category, and display the respective posts
on these pages by passing a second argument to Realblog_blog():</p>
<pre>{{{Realblog_blog(false, 'Category 1');}}}</pre>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-archive">Archive</h3>
<p>To display the blog archive on a CMSimple_XH page, write:</p>
<pre>{{{Realblog_archive();}}}</pre>
<p>To also display the search form, write:</p>
<pre>{{{Realblog_archive(true);}}}</pre>
<p>Note that the blog archive must <em>not</em> be on the same page as the
actual blog.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-rss">RSS feed</h3>
<p>If enabled in the configuration, Realblog_XH automatically offers an RSS feed
with the published blog posts. Optionally, you can display an RSS feed icon that
links to the feed in the template:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo Realblog_feedLink();?&gt;</pre>
<p>Besides some feed related settings in the configuration, there are some
settings in the language file in the section "RSS". Most important is "page",
where you have to enter the URL of the page on which the main blog is shown.
It's best to navigate to this page and copy and paste everything after the
question mark up to, but not including, the first ampersand (&amp;), if any,
from the browser's address bar.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-comments">Comments</h3>
<p>To add a commenting facility to your blog, you have to install a compatible
comments plugin and enter its name in Realblog_XH's configuration.</p>
<p>Note for implementers: to be compatible with Realblog_XH you have to write a
class named %YOURPLUGIN%_RealblogBridge which implements the interface
Realblog\CommentsBridge, which is defined and documented in
plugins/realblog/classes/CommentsBridge.php. Make sure this class and its
dependencies are loaded when Realblog_XH needs it.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="bc">Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>Realblog_XH is mostly backward compatible to Realblog 2.8, so you can reuse
its data files (realblog.txt) and use its plugin calls. However, the old plugin
calls are deprecated, and may be removed in the future.</p>
<p>The RSS feed files (realblog_rss_feed.xml) are not used anymore&mdash;instead
the feeds are built dynamically. You should delete the old files, so that news
readers will not grab the old contents.</p>
